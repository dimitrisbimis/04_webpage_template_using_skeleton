      <h3>Dimitris Bimis</h3>
      <p>I am a 1st year undergrad student at NTUA School of Architecture. This is my website for ARCH 4342 Computational Methods in Creative Arts and Sciences. 
         <p>As part of this course, I’ve been exploring programming; an area I find both challenging and rewarding and I'm currently working on this website (one day it will become really impressive, I swear!).</p>
        <p>Alongside my architectural studies, I’ve developed an interest in Photoshop and sketching. These creative outlets have become a part of my daily routine. I really enjoy engaging with these two and it is actually really fulfilling to see my skills improve in areas closely connected to both my academic journey and future professional path.</p> <p> Have a look at my projects. </p>

        <img src="images/burger.png" class ="scale-with-grid" alt="How to make a cheeseburger">
        <p>In this project, I worked with pseudocode and flowcharts to describe simple everyday tasks. Through this, I came to understand the challenge of describing actions in a way that removes any reliance on prior experience and focuses solely, on basic operations. (photo cover is made by Craig Stephens)</p>

        <img src="images/mondrian.png" class ="scale-with-grid" alt="Mondrian's Canvas">
        <p>Mondrian's Canvas was my first attempt to parametric programming. The result varies depending on the coordinates of the user's mouse.</p>
        <p>You can see the project alongside the code <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/mhtsos/sketches/mNC39nz3M" target="_blank"> here</a> </p>

      <div class="four columns">
        <img src="images/ellipses.png" class ="scale-with-grid" alt="Chaotic ovals">
        <p>In this experiment, I address randomness. Every aspect of this code is random, so everytime the user runs the code, the results come up differently.</p>
        <p> You can see it <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/mhtsos/sketches/nDRT50b2J" target="_blank"> here</a> </p>

      <div class="four columns">
        <img src="images/bezier.png" class ="scale-with-grid" alt="Bezier's unpredictable guidance">
        <p>Expanding the field of randomness in code, I created this project. Every aspect is again defined completely random and for that, the result is different every time.</p>

        <img src="images/trapezoid.png" class ="scale-with-grid" alt="LeWitt's Trapezoid">
        <p>Sol LeWiit was an artist who believed that “the idea becomes a machine that makes the art.” That's why I attempted to recreate his piece of art ''The Location of a Trapezoid'' with code, using a machine.</p>
        <p>You can see the whole thought process for ''LeWitt's Trapezoid'' and additional info for ''Mondrian's Canvas'', ''Chaotic ovals'' and ''Bezier's unpredictable guidance'' <a href="ASSIGNMENT 02-2.pdf" target="_blank"> here </a> </p>

        <img src="images/grid.png" class="scale-with-grid" alt="Arrays & Iteration">
        <p>This sketch makes a grid of smaller colorful squares you can click to change color. With that project I learned to work with the concept of arrays and loops in coding.</p>

        <img src="images/sierpinski.png" class="scale-with-grid" alt="Sierpinski's Squares">
        <p>Digging into the concept of loops in coding, I tried to recreate the Sierpinski's square in p5.</p>

      <div class="four columns">
        <img src="images/agario.png" class="scale-with-grid" alt="Computer Game">
        <p>Here I wanted to create a computer game utilizing and profiting the concepts I have learned with the last few codes I made. First taking inspiration from the classic snake game and then from the viral game agar.io.</p>

        <img src="images/final.png" class="scale-with-grid" alt="Final Project">
        <p>My team and I wanted to create an interactive application to improve people's experience at concerts and parties. For that reason we made a photorythmic that reacts to the viewers' signals based on its emotional state by changing colours.</p>
