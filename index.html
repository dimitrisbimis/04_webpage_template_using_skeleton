      <h3>Dimitris Bimis</h3>
      <p>I am a 1st year undergrad student at NTUA School of Architecture. This is my website for ARCH 4342 Computational Methods in Creative Arts and Sciences. 
         <p>As part of this course, I’ve been exploring programming; an area I find both challenging and rewarding and I'm currently working on this website (one day it will become really impressive, I swear!).</p>
        <p>Alongside my architectural studies, I’ve developed an interest in Photoshop and sketching. These creative outlets have become a part of my daily routine. I really enjoy engaging with these two and it is actually really fulfilling to see my skills improve in areas closely connected to both my academic journey and future professional path.</p> <p> Have a look at my projects. </p>

        <p>In this project, I worked with pseudocode and flowcharts to describe simple everyday tasks. Through this, I came to understand the challenge of describing actions in a way that removes any reliance on prior experience and focuses solely, on basic operations.

        <p>Mondrian's Canvas was my first attempt to parametric programming. The result varies depending on the coordinates of the user's mouse.</p>
        <p>You can see the project alongside the code <a href="https://editor.p5js.org/mhtsos/sketches/mNC39nz3M" target="_blank"> here</a> </p>

        <p>In this experiment, I address randomness. Every aspect of this code is random, so everytime the user runs the code, the results come up differently.</p>

        <p>Expanding the field of randomness in code, I created this project. Every aspect is again defined completely random and for that, the result is different every time.</p>

        <p> Sol LeWiit was an artist who believed that “the idea becomes a machine that makes the art.” Thats why I attempted to recreate his piece of art ''The Location of a Trapezoid'' with code, using a machine.</p>
        <p> You can see the whole thought process for ''LeWitt's Trapezoid'' and additional info for ''Mondrian's Canvas'', ''Chaotic ovals'' and ''Bezier's unpredictable guidance'' <a href="ASSIGNMENT 02-2.pdf" target="_blank"> here<a/> </p>
