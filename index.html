      <h3>Dimitris Bimis</h3>
      <p>I am a 1st year undergrad student at NTUA School of Architecture. This is my website for ARCH 4342 Computational Methods in Creative Arts and Sciences. 
         <p>As part of this course, I’ve been exploring programming; an area I find both challenging and rewarding and I'm currently working on this website (one day it will become really impressive, I swear!).</p>
        <p>Alongside my architectural studies, I’ve developed an interest in Photoshop and sketching. These creative outlets have become a part of my daily routine. I really enjoy engaging with these two and it is actually really fulfilling to see my skills improve in areas closely connected to both my academic journey and future professional path.</p> <p> Have a look at my projects. </p>
